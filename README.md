## About the Internship
The internship focuses on enhancing Java programming skills through hands-on tasks and real-world projects. It is an excellent opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of Java fundamentals and advanced concepts.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language for the tasks.
- **IDE**: Eclipse, NetBeans etc.
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for code management.

## Project Tasks
Here are the tasks/projects included in this repository:
1. **[Task 1: Number-Game](https://github.com/uborkar/Codsoft-Internship/tree/Task-1-Number-Game)**  
   - Brief description of the task
   - Generate a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100.
   - Prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number.
   - Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.
   - Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number.
   - You can incorporate additional details as follows:
   - Limit the number of attempts the user has to guess the number.
   - Add the option for multiple rounds, allowing the user to play again.
   - Display the user's score, which can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.
     
2. **[Task 2: Student Grade Calculator](link-to-task2-folder)**  
   - Brief description of the task.
   - Input: Take marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject.
   - Calculate Total Marks: Sum up the marks obtained in all subjects.
   - Calculate Average Percentage: Divide the total marks by the total number of subjects to get the average percentage.
   - Grade Calculation: Assign grades based on the average percentage achieved.
   - Display Results: Show the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user.
     
3. **[Task 3: CURRENCY CONVERTER](link-to-task3-folder)**  
   - Brief description of the task.
   - Currency Selection: Allow the user to choose the base currency and the target currency.
   - Currency Rates: Fetch real-time exchange rates from a reliable API.
   - Amount Input: Take input from the user for the amount they want to convert.
   - Currency Conversion: Convert the input amount from the base currency to the target currency using the fetched exchange rate.
   - Display Result: Show the converted amount and the target currency symbol to the user.
